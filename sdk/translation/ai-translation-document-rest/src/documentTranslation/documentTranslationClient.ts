   * Some query
   * parameters can be used to filter the returned list (ex:
   * "status=Succeeded,Cancelled") will only return succeeded and cancelled
   * operations.
   * createdDateTimeUtcStart and createdDateTimeUtcEnd can be used
   * combined or separately to specify a range of datetime to filter the returned
   * list by.
   * The supported filtering query parameters are (status, ids,
   * createdDateTimeUtcStart, createdDateTimeUtcEnd).
   *
   * The server honors
   * the values specified by the client. However, clients must be prepared to handle
   * responses that contain a different page size or contain a continuation token.

   * skip and then top on the collection.
   * Note: If the server can't honor top
   * and/or skip, the server must return an error to the client informing about it
   * instead of just ignoring the query options.
