 * This sample demonstrates how to lists the endpoints that a Batch Compute Node under this Batch Account may call as part of Batch service administration. If you are deploying a Pool inside of a virtual network that you specify, you must make sure your network allows outbound access to these endpoints. Failure to allow access to these endpoints may cause Batch to mark the affected nodes as unusable. For more information about creating a pool inside of a virtual network, see https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-virtual-network.
