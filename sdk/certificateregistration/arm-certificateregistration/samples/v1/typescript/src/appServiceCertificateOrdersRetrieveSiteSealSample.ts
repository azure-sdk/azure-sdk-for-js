 * This sample demonstrates how to this method is used to obtain the site seal information for an issued certificate. A site seal is a graphic that the certificate purchaser can embed on their web site to show their visitors information about their SSL certificate. If a web site visitor clicks on the site seal image, a pop-up page is displayed that contains detailed information about the SSL certificate. The site seal token is used to link the site seal graphic image to the appropriate certificate details pop-up page display when a user clicks on the site seal. The site seal images are expected to be static images and hosted by the reseller, to minimize delays for customer page load times.
